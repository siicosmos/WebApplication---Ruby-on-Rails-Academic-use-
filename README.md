<h1 align="center">CMPT 276 Project Proposal</h1>
  
##### Project Overview:  
&ensp;&ensp;Pizza Cluster is a pizza-ordering website. Pizzas are from many restaurants. Once users create an account, they can edit their information, personalize their preferences, bookmark their favourite restaurants and save their previous orders and reorder with just one click! If the users are not sure about what they want, they can browse through the menu and use special filters (e.g. price, distance, rating...) to find the best fitting restaurant for them. Additionally, the users get exclusive limited offers specifically based on their preferences and order history. Last but not least, users can track their order live through the order tracker.  

##### Conceptual implementation:  
&ensp;&ensp;Ordering pizza online using Pizza Cluster would certainly improve the overall experience of the customer as customer would have more time to consider different options and user-friendly interface would help the user to see the end product before finalizing it. The main features of the web application would be following:  

* User information:  
	* Login Credentials  
	* Order history of the user and based on that the user will get future suggestions.  
	* Reward-Points. For every purchase user will get points which he/she can redeem on the next purchase.  
* Interactive Ordering Process:  
	* User will be able to select from large variety of options.  
	* User will be able to see the feedback of other customers about a certain type of bread or topping and based on that he can select his options.  
	* User will be assisted with interactive interface where he would be able to see the final pizza before finalizing it.  
	* Easy Payment option (Debit/Credit).  
* Real Time Tracking:  
	* User can check the status of his order in real time.  
	* User would be able to track the delivery person using Google maps.
